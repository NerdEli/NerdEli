## ðŸ‘‹ Information
Hey, my name is Eli! Thanks for coming to my profile! I enjoy doing backend work and mainly anything that involves infrastructure and lots of planning. I prefer using **NodeJS** in either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** but am typically open to learning new languages as well. If you think that we'd be good friends, check out my discord below and join the community!
