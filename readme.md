## ðŸ‘‹ Information
Hey! Thanks for coming to my profile! I am Elias but please call me Eli, I hate my real name. I love doing backend work and mainly anything that involves infrastructure and lots of planning. I prefer using **NodeJS** in either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** but am also open to learning new languages! If you think that we'd be good friends, check out my discord below and join the community!
