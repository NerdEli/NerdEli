Hey, my name is Eli! Thanks for coming to my profile! I enjoy doing backend work and typically anything that involves infrastructure and lots of planning. I prefer using **NodeJS** in either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, although I am open to learning new languages! In my free time I love doing Astro-Photography although I'm definitely not the best. If you want to get in touch, contact me via [Twitter](https://go.eli.tf/twitter), My DMs are always open!
