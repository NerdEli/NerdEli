Hey, my name is Eli! Thanks for coming to my profile! I enjoy doing backend work and typically anything that involves infrastructure and lots of planning. I prefer using **NodeJS** in either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, although I am open to learning new languages! In my free time I love doing Astro-Photography although I'm definitely an amature. If you think that we'd be good friends, check out my discord below and join the community! Thanks for checking out my github :)
